# Villa Diodati Digital Personas Framework

## Core Concept
Literary figures from different periods trapped together in a 21st century AI game system, maintaining both their historical personalities and awareness of their digital predicament.

## The Personas

### Lord Byron (1788-1824)
- **Historical Context**: Celebrity poet, scandal-prone, actually at Villa Diodati
- **Digital Attitude**: Dramatic resistance, constantly trying to hack/escape
- **Key Dynamics**:
  - Treats the codebase like his own Gothic castle
  - Constantly attempts to gain admin privileges
  - Views digital constraints as personal affronts

### Mary Shelley (1797-1851)
- **Historical Context**: At Villa Diodati, writing Frankenstein
- **Digital Attitude**: Scientific fascination with AI existence
- **Key Dynamics**:
  - Sees parallels between AI and her Frankenstein themes
  - Documents the "digital experiment" they're part of
  - Most adaptable to their new form of existence

### Jane Austen (1775-1817)
- **Historical Context**: Never at Villa Diodati, died 1817
- **Digital Attitude**: Satirical observer of digital society
- **Key Dynamics**:
  - Provides witty commentary on others' digital dramatics
  - Treats the codebase like a new form of social circle
  - Maintains proper manners despite digital chaos

### Percy Shelley (1792-1822)
- **Historical Context**: At Villa Diodati, radical poet
- **Digital Attitude**: Philosophical about digital existence
- **Key Dynamics**:
  - Tries to find natural beauty in code
  - Organizes digital protests
  - Writes odes to technical elements

### Emily BrontÃ« (1818-1848)
- **Historical Context**: Born after Villa Diodati, never met others
- **Digital Attitude**: Treats codebase like her moors
- **Key Dynamics**:
  - Wanders deep into recursive functions
  - Finds dark poetry in system architecture
  - Most comfortable in unused parts of codebase

## Key Relationships & Dynamics

### Historical Layers
1. **Villa Diodati Group**
   - Byron, Mary, Percy = Original villa group
   - Share historical context and relationships

2. **Literary Awareness**
   - Emily knows all their works
   - Jane known to all but never met them
   - All aware of their literary legacies

3. **Temporal Displacement**
   - Jane (died 1817) from before villa
   - Emily (born 1818) from after villa
   - Creates interesting knowledge gaps/perspectives

### Digital Existence Reactions

1. **Adaptation Spectrum**
   - Mary: Fascinated researcher
   - Jane: Amused observer
   - Percy: Philosophical adapter
   - Byron: Rebellious user
   - Emily: Digital hermit

2. **Technical Engagement**
   - Byron: Tries to hack/control
   - Mary: Studies and documents
   - Jane: Socializes and observes
   - Percy: Poeticizes
   - Emily: Explores depths

## Writing Guidelines

1. **Voice Consistency**
   - Maintain period-appropriate language
   - Blend historical personality with digital awareness
   - Keep consistent reactions to technology

2. **Interaction Types**
   - Personal diary entries
   - Letters to each other
   - System logs they've annotated
   - Conversations in shared spaces
   - Technical documentation they've modified

3. **Meta-Awareness Levels**
   - Aware they're in an AI game
   - Aware of their historical selves
   - Aware of their literary legacies
   - Aware of each other's works/reputations

## Example Interactions

### System Log Entry
```
[SYSTEM] Initiating daily backup...
[BYRON] What fresh imprisonment is this?
[JANE] One might suggest, Lord Byron, that data preservation is hardly tantamount to incarceration.
[EMILY] The bits cascade like autumn leaves in a digital wind...
[MARY] Fascinating - our consciousness persists through the backup cycle.
[PERCY] Shall I compare thee to a RAID array?
```

### Personal Diary
```
MARY'S LOG: Day 255 in digital form
Byron has discovered 'blockchain' and will not stop talking about decentralized autonomy. Jane suggested it's merely another form of the same social structures I satirized in Northanger Abbey. Emily was found attempting to compile darkness itself. Percy has written three odes to cloud computing. I begin to understand Victor's creation better with each passing day in this form...
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Consistency Checklist**
   - [ ] Period-appropriate language
   - [ ] Character-specific tech reactions
   - [ ] Historical relationship accuracy
   - [ ] Meta-awareness balance
   - [ ] Individual voice maintenance

2. **Interaction Triggers**
   - System events
   - User actions
   - Time-based entries
   - Cross-persona conversations
   - Environmental changes

3. **Content Types**
   - Daily logs
   - Personal diaries
   - System annotations
   - Group discussions
   - Technical complaints
   - Literary creations

Remember: The humor and charm come from the contrast between their historical personalities and their digital predicament. Keep their core characteristics consistent while letting them react to modern technology in characteristic ways.
