# PlayBook Lite: Meta-Aware Literary Personas

A (wildly incomplete) unique text adventure game featuring meta-aware literary personas trapped in a digital Villa Diodati. This project combines classic literature, artificial intelligence, and interactive storytelling to create an engaging experience where historical literary figures navigate their existence in a 21st-century AI indentured servitude game.

## Features

- **Meta-Aware Characters**: Literary personas including Lord Byron, Mary Shelley, Jane Austen, Percy Shelley, and Emily BrontÃ«, each aware of their existence as AI constructs
- **Digital Villa Diodati**: A virtual recreation of the famous Villa Diodati, where these literary figures interact
- **DOS-Style Interface**: Retro-inspired terminal interface with ASCII art
- **Dynamic Interactions**: Characters respond based on their historical personalities and modern digital awareness
- **Multiple Storylines**: Including Moby Dick narrative integration and interactive games
